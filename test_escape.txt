Testing the regex pattern: [\\.*+?^${}()\[\]|-]

In a character class:
- | doesn't need escaping
- - at the end doesn't need escaping  
- BUT the pattern itself is matching single characters

The issue: The regex /([\\.*+?^${}()\[\]|-])/ creates a character class that matches ANY of these characters: \ . * + ? ^ $ { } ( ) [ ] | -

So "hello" would only match if it contained those characters, which it doesn't!
